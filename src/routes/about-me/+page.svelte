    I have always loved the language the computers speak, honestlty if I could speak it I would <br />
    but I can't so I learned how to solve problems using code. I specialize in golang as <br />
    the language of choice, with a choice of relational and non-relational databases. <br />
    Despite a deep focus in golang and databases I do have a full understanding workings <br />
    of the frontend technologies, as I have shown by building this very website from <br />
    scratch. I have engaged in activities to solve daily problems with the use of the <br />
    computer language, frankly nothings excites me more than seeing my code compiling <br />
    successfully and actually functional.
